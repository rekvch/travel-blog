Travelling in beautiful Thailand travel definitely includes a bit of classic Asia sensory overload.</p>

You can even wander amongst the ruins of former Thai kingdoms. One thing’s for sure – you’ll never be bored when you travel Thailand.</p><br>

                <h3 class="info">One of the biggest temples in Krabi, Wat Kaew Korawaram, sits within the center of Krabi Town and is a must-see attraction. The white temple features a beautiful staircase that leads in with ornate carvings and gold dragons. Because of the decoration, during the sunset hours, the temple turns golden, making it look even better.</h3><br>

                <h3 class="info1">Koh Hong, or Hong Island, is located in the province of Krabi, in the south of Thailand. This little jewel, whose name means “room island”, enchants visitors with its breathtaking natural beauty and its fairy-like charm. Hong Island is best known for its incredibly impressive limestone formations and is certainly one of the most beautiful islands in all of Thailand. But not only the limestone cliffs are stunning, also the bay with the fine white powdered sugar beach of Hong Island is truly breathtakingly beautiful. Another highlight on the island is the Hong Lagoon, which is only accessible by boat through a narrow opening.</h3><br>

                <h3 class="info1">A sweeping staircase leads to the Buddha statues. Note that the stairs are only to climb up; you are not allowed to walk them down. There is a separate way down on the hillside, and a security guard sitting there all day makes sure people respect this rule. Don’t worry if you forgot to take your photos and selfies the first time, as it’s easy to go back on the way out. <br><br>If you wonder or worry, There are 94 steps to reach the Big Buddha and climbing them is relatively easy (thank you to our reader Joni for counting them for us!). A few steps to the west, another short staircase will take you to a terrace from which you’ll get a beautiful view of Kata Bay and Kata Noi Bay. You might even recognise Promthep Cape and even Nai Harn Windmill. The best spot to see the third bay is to stop at the restaurant on the way up. From there, you’ll get a magnificent panorama of Karon Beach.</h3><br>

                <h3 class="info">Traditional Thai paintings often depict scenes from Buddhist mythology, literature, history, or daily life, blending realism and symbolism. They are mostly found in temples and palaces, where they serve as decorations and illustrations of religious texts. To solve composition problems in empty spaces, Sintao is an important technique used in traditional Thai paintings, which involves dividing the image into sections using secondary elements such as trees, mountains, streams, and rocks, or lines with different patterns.</h3><br>

                <h3 class="info1">Thai cooking places emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with strong aromatic components and a spicy edge. Australian chef David Thompson, an expert on Thai food, observes that unlike many other cuisines, Thai cooking is "about the juggling of disparate elements to create a harmonious finish. Like a complex musical chord it's got to have a smooth surface but it doesn't matter what's happening underneath. Simplicity isn't the dictum here, at all."</h3><br>
